        Hi! My name is Aishwarya Goyal and this is my artist website. I am from
        Panchkula, India. I am 29 years old. My study background is in Computer
        Science Engineering. I have done M.Tech in the same. And then I landed
        up in this art field. Which was totally fascinating for me. Just like a
        dream world, fantasy. I have been painting for 5 years now. I like
        working in watercolors, oil paints and acrylics. Though I have many
        works in simple pencil shading and pen work also. I like making
        realistic paintings and dive into the intricacaies. I also like simple
        minimal art, and sometimes abstract art. My hobbies apart from painting
        are dancing, listening to music, playing guitar, reading books,
        journalling, watching movies and cartoons, and travelling. If you have
        landed up on my site, I would love to know you. Feel free to contact me
        and leave a message or so below.

        The painting that you see here is a commissioned work for someone. I
        made this butterfly in acrylic paints. Acrylic colors are very good for
        making speedy art or art that involves bold strokes or patches. They are
        water-based and not messy like the oil-based oil paints. They fill the
        gap between water colors and oil colors. I would love to know your
        experiences with colors if you had got a chance to use them. Feel free
        to message me below.
